# Translate App - a python and batch file

A simple python program that opens google translate and returns the translation of an english phrase in 3 different languages

A batch script is included to run the python program from the command line

Make sure you have the environment path set correctly ( documents\batch\translate if you cloned to a documents\batch directory)

To run type `$ translate "some phrase" ` in the terminal

# Todo

1. Allow the user to limit the languages used
2. Return results to terminal

* I created this program because I found it tedious to keep opening google translate over and over again
* I hope you find it as helpful as I did
